## 🎭 What's All the Fuss About?

Imagine if CNN, Reddit, and a fortune-teller had a baby, and that baby was raised by AI. That's NewsAI! We're not just aggregating news; we're revolutionizing how you experience information:

- 🔮 **Gemini-Powered Insights**: Google's Gemini AI is our crystal ball!
- 🧠 **BERT-Based Sentiment Analysis**: We don't just read news; we feel it in our circuits!
- 🚀 **FastAPI Backend**: So fast, it breaks the space-time continuum!
- 🖥️ **Streamlit Dashboard**: Where data visualization meets modern art!
- 🍃 **MongoDB**: Because our data is too cool for tables!
